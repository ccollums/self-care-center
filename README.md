## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. The Self Care Center
site is meant to produce a random affirmation or mantra (your choice) to inspire you throughout your day.
